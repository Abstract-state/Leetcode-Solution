Hi Tanusree,

I hope this email finds you well.

I didn't update you with my work for the previous week as I was focused on making changes to the project, algorithm, and presentation based on our rehearsals. Additionally, I worked on finalizing and completing the project documents.

Today, we had our final demo, and Udbhav, Tejas, and I would greatly appreciate your feedback on our project and the work we did individually.

I hope I met the standards expected of an intern and would love to hear your thoughts on my performance.

Moreover, a call with you before our last working day this Friday would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and guidance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
