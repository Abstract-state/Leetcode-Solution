Greetings everyone,

I, Asmith, am delighted to welcome you all to the Project Demo of CMT 7, titled "Cryptocurrency Arbitrage."

Today's presentation will commence with an overview of our problem statement, followed by an in-depth examination of our solution architecture. We will also delve into the business implications for Wells Fargo, discussing the challenges we faced and the insights we gained. Additionally, we will explore the three core components—algorithm, backend, and UI—in meticulous detail. Finally, we will consider potential future enhancements before concluding our session.

Let us begin with an overview of the problem statement.

Our objective is to develop an algorithm for cryptocurrency arbitrage, a strategy that leverages price discrepancies across various exchanges by purchasing at a lower price and selling at a higher price to realize a profit.

To achieve this objective, we adhered to a structured pathway with clearly defined milestones. This included data collection, arbitrage detection, and consideration of transaction costs. We enhanced our algorithm's robustness by integrating risk management and refining our execution strategy. Ultimately, we implemented continuous automated monitoring to ensure no potential opportunities were overlooked.

Thank you, and let us proceed with the problem statement overview.
